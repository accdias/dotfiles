# vim:fileencoding=utf-8:foldmethod=marker

#: Colors {{{

# cursor #cccccc
cursor #ff5a00

#: Default cursor color. If set to the special value none the cursor
#: will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. It's color will be
#: the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text will be
#: rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that if the
#: program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this takes
#: precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast.

# cursor_text_color #111111

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored.



# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0
inactive_text_alpha .25

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).



# active_tab_foreground   #000
# active_tab_background   #eee
# active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
# inactive_tab_foreground #444
# inactive_tab_background #999
# inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles.

# tab_bar_background none

#: Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

# tab_bar_margin_color none

#: Color for the tab bar margin area. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color for margins above and below the tab bar. For side
#: margins the default color is chosen to match the background color
#: of the neighboring tab.


# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

# background_opacity 1.0
background_opacity 0.95

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped or centered.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
